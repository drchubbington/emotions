Dataset used for a deep learning project. The project itself was done in Google Colab.

Here, I practiced designing and testing my own model with Tensorflow using a Kaggle dataset. Unfortunately, the model overfit the data, even when I referred to their model solution. This project, while not complete, marked the beginning of my deeper dive into AI!
